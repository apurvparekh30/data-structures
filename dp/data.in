Hello Olivia,

Thank you for sharing this information. I am having some questions regarding this process. If I decide
not to proceed further with the scheduled interview what will be my application status? I am still
eligible to apply for further software engineer positions in June/August.

I am an international student in United States. Am I eligible to continue my process with Google Asia Pacific Software Engineering roles. 
What will the next steps? Are there going to be onsite interviews or only phone interviews? How does this 
will affect my eligibility for further applications in United States?
